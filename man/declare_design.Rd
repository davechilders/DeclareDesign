\arguments{
\item{population}{A population object, as created by \code{\link{declare_population}}.}

\item{assignment}{An assignment object, as created by \code{\link{declare_assignment}}.}

\item{estimator}{An estimator object, as created by \code{\link{declare_estimator}}. Optionally a list of estimator objects.}

\item{potential_outcomes}{A potential_outcomes object, as created by \code{\link{declare_potential_outcomes}}. Optionally a list of potential_outcomes objects.}

\item{inputs}{An inputs object, as create by \code{\link{declare_inputs}}, with the data and code required to replicate the design.}

\value{
A design object
}
\description{
This function gathers together the declarations for population, sampling, assignment, estimator(s), and potential outcomes. Design objects can be summarized with summary(my_design), diagnosed with diagnose_design(my_design), and modified with modify_design(my_design).
